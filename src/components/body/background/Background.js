            <p className="bck-p">My love for programming started at my very young age I was in my early years in High School, when i discovered how fascinating computers are when dealing with <a href='https://www.coursera.org/articles/computer-science-vs-information-technology' target='blank' className="link bck-lnk">communication and information technology</a>. I got more and more into computers as i moved up in classes and development levels as computers became available to me. I then decided to buy a personal computer of my own so i would have one readily available to me at all times.<br /><br /> I was curious as to what more i could do with my PC other than just some microsoft word and Corel drawing. I found out that computers can be given commands as to what to display on screen for audiences using not just MS word, but a software that deals with codes and computer languages. I then decided that i would want to learn and know how that is done.<br /><br /> That is how i started my journey in learn <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/' target='blank' className="link bck-lnk">basic HTML and CSS</a> on my own while i carry on with my High School classes. To be honest, i could not wait to graduate from High School and learn this art for real in a university with good and available resources.<br /><br /> After my graduation i moved to the United States to further my education in <a href='https://www.invisionapp.com/defined/web-design-and-development' target='blank' className="link bck-lnk">Web design and development</a>, i felt comfortable moving here as i was moving to study in a university belonging to my religion.
