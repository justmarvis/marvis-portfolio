                    <p>Starting my education in business informatics at Idaho State University, I was able to learn and understand the school system in U.S, as ISU was the first university I started my high level education at. I studied the basics of informative science at ISU, been introduced to this university by a couple of friends fo mine, I knew little to nothing of what I was getting myself into in regards to a higher education. It was more or less a struggle getting used to the system here as u have mentioned before, but after a few weeks in school, I had gotten used to it and and catching up as well. I spent about a year and a half before deciding to continue my process in a different fields...I did ask for a major change at Idaho State University, but the area of field I was interested in was not credited, so i decided to search for a different school that credit such, At the Brigham young University-Idaho, web design and development was offered, so i had found the course/major that wou;d help me groom my skills for a career. I am currently a junior in my major and have a coup of semesters before i graduate and continue the res of my life's journey in success.
